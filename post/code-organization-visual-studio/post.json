In this post I’ll try to explain how Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio keeps that control.</p>

<h3 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h3>
<p>Both Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio organize our code, assets, libraries and other stuff in a structure called <em>Solution</em>, all this information is stored within a file with extension <strong>.sln</strong>. The <strong>.sln</strong> file is an (usually) automatically generated plain text file that tells the IDE where to find the projects related to our application.</p>

<p>This is how a Solution (the free C#/F# shirt app solution) looks like when opened in Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio:</p>

<p><figure><img src='/postimages/post/code-organization-visual-studio/post.jsonsln-opened.png' alt='“Image of opened solutions” images_set' /></figure></p>

<p>And this is how a the same file looks like when opened in a plain text editor.</p>

<dl>
<dt>1. Solution</dt>
<dd>The file itself, the name we see in the IDE is the same name of the file plus the <code>.sln</code> extension.</dd>
<dt>2. Solution folder</dt>
<dd>These are logical folders that we can use to organize our solution.</dd>
<dt>3. Shared project</dt>
<dd>A shared project (we'll talk about them on a later post).</dd>
<dt>4. C# project</dt>
<dd>A C# project, in this case refers to an Android project, in Xamarin is a convention to use the <code>.Droid</code> suffix to denote that.</dd>
<dt>5. C# project</dt>
<dd>Another C# project, in this case refers to an iOS project, in Xamarin is a convention to use the <code>.iOS</code> suffix to denote that.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id=\"the-somethingproj-file\">The .[something]proj file</h3>

<p>As I mentioned above, the Solution keeps track of the projects that comprise our application, but what is exactly a project?</p>

<p>Well, a Project is a logical way to organize a project’s files (classes, resources, images…) it is described in a file ending with <code>proj</code>, being <code>.csproj</code> for C# projects, <code>.shproj</code> for shared, other kind of projects end in <code>.vbproj</code>, <code>.jsproj</code>, etc.</p>

<p>As you can see in the previous image, the <code>.sln</code> file contains “links” to these projects.</p>

<p>These are the projects for the Free Xamarin Shirt App:</p>

<h3 id=\"tldr\">tl;dr</h3>
<p>We can explain how is our code organized with a simple diagram.</p>
