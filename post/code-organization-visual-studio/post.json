In this post I’ll try to explain how Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio keeps that control.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-solution\">The Solution</h3>\n<p>Both Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio organize our code, assets, libraries and other stuff in a structure called <em>Solution</em>, all this information is stored within a file with extension <strong>.sln</strong>. The <strong>.sln</strong> file is an (usually) automatically generated plain text file that tells the IDE where to find the projects related to our application.</p>\n\n<p>post_image solution-in-folder.png “Image of a solution file”</p>\n\n<p>This is how a Solution (the free C#/F# shirt app solution) looks like when opened in Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio:</p>\n\n<p>post_image sln-opened.png “Image of opened solutions”</p>\n\n<p>And this is how a the same file looks like when opened in a plain text editor.</p>\n\n<p>post_image sln-plain-text-explained-2.png “Image of opened solutions”</p>\n\n<dl>\n<dt>1. Solution</dt>\n<dd>The file itself, the name we see in the IDE is the same name of the file plus the <code>.sln</code> extension.</dd>\n<dt>2. Solution folder</dt>\n<dd>These are logical folders that we can use to organize our solution.</dd>\n<dt>3. Shared project</dt>\n<dd>A shared project (we'll talk about them on a later post).</dd>\n<dt>4. C# project</dt>\n<dd>A C# project, in this case refers to an Android project, in Xamarin is a convention to use the <code>.Droid</code> suffix to denote that.</dd>\n<dt>5. C# project</dt>\n<dd>Another C# project, in this case refers to an iOS project, in Xamarin is a convention to use the <code>.iOS</code> suffix to denote that.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-somethingproj-file\">The .[something]proj file</h3>\n\n<p>As I mentioned above, the Solution keeps track of the projects that comprise our application, but what is exactly a project?</p>\n\n<p>Well, a Project is a logical way to organize a project’s files (classes, resources, images…) it is described in a file ending with <code>proj</code>, being <code>.csproj</code> for C# projects, <code>.shproj</code> for shared, other kind of projects end in <code>.vbproj</code>, <code>.jsproj</code>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see in the previous image, the <code>.sln</code> file contains “links” to these projects.</p>\n\n<p>These are the projects for the Free Xamarin Shirt App:</p>\n\n<p>post_image freeshirtappproject.png “Xamarin Free Shirt App”</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tldr\">tl;dr</h3>\n<p>We can explain how is our code organized with a simple diagram.</p>\n\n<p>post_image Solution-diagram.jpg “Diagram of how solution works”</p>\n"
